# HTML & CSS Workshop Project

This project was created as part of an HTML and CSS workshop I attended. The workshop focused on building a simple single-page website using only HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design file provided to us. We then deployed the result to the web using Netlify.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the basics of HTML and CSS, including layout structure, typography, and basic styling techniques, all derived from a Figma design file provided during the workshop. The site is a static single-page layout showcasing a typical landing page design.

### Features

- **Figma-Based Design:** The HTML structure and CSS styling were developed based on a provided Figma file.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the site adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Simple Layout:** Organized with a header, main content, and footer.
- **Basic Styling:** Custom fonts, colors, and spacing for a clean look.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for content structure
- **CSS3** for styling and layout
- **Figma** for design inspiration and layout reference
